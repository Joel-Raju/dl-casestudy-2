# dl-casestudy-2

build the following generative models to generate images using the Yelp dataset.

1. a DCGAN

2. a WGAN

3. a VAE (variational autoencoder)

4. a cGAN (to generate the images as per the label [food, drink, inside, outside])

Evaluate the models using Inception Score and Frechet Inception Distance using a pretrained model

Submit 5 generated images (atleast one for each label in the cGAN) using each model

At the top of your ipynb files, share the 5 generated faces using each model and the IS and FID metrics for each model. Clear and specific responses are expected.

Deploy any 2 GAN models, the CNN model and the transfer learnt model and any 2 of your transformer models to detect sentiment as a Yelp dataset project and share a link to a video recording demo-ing each of your models. Share a GIT repo with all your code correctly added across three branches development, test and production. With each member of the group committing to GIT their part of the code. Present your deployed models and your tuning efforts in the next class.

Submit your ipynb file run end-to-end sequentially, and convert it to pdf.
